<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>
The information contained in the SAP Library documentation represents SAP's current view of

<h2>Gender-Neutral Language</h2>
<p>
As far as possible, SAP documentation is gender neutral. 
Depending on the context, the reader is addressed directly with "you", or a gender-neutral noun 
(such as "sales person" or "working days") is used. If when referring to members of both sexes, 
however, the third person singular cannot be avoided or a gender-neutral noun does not exist, 
SAP reserves the right to use the masculine form of the noun and pronoun. 
This is to ensure that the documentation remains comprehensible.
