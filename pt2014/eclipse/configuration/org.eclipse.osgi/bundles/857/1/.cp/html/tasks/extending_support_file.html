<h1>Extending the Support File to Include Additional Information</h1>

<p>In rare cases it can happen that for detailed troubleshooting some additional information is required. 
You can then use the Support Information Collector utility to generate an <b>extended support file</b> version.   
</p>

<!-- Prerequisites section -->
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
<li>SAP support requests you, the SAP customer, to provide additional information in your OSS support message. </li>
</ul>

<!-- Procedure section -->
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Launch the Support Information Collector, as described for the procedure: 
	<a href="creating_support_file.html">Creating a Support File.</a>  </li> 
	<li>In the <i>Collect Support Information</i> dialog, expand the <b>Additional data</b> area.</li> 
	<li>Select the additional support data that you need to add to the support file to be created.

	<p><i>Figure: Selection of additional support data in case ABAP Development Tools is installed</i></p> 
	
	<table border="1" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
    <tr>
  	<td width="15%" valign="top" align="left"><b>Additional Support Data</b></td>
    <td width="85%" valign="top" align="left"><b>Meaning</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
  	<td width="15%" valign="top" align="left">Communication Log</td>
    <td width="85%" valign="top" align="left">
    The ABAP communication log collects the data on the RFC communication between the IDE client and the ABAP back-end system. 
    <p>
    You may need to provide this type of additional information if RFC communication issues are suspected as causing the problem reported. 
    </p>
    <p>PREREQUISITES:</p>
    <p>To enable the communication log (in case ABAP Development Tools is installed), you have to switch on the corresponding setting in the preferences:
    <b>ABAP Development > Enable communication log</b>
    </p>
    <p><img src="images/create_support_file_extended.png"></p>
    <p>NOTE:</p>
    <p>The collector does not write out the passwords used for communication with the back-end system. 
    Passwords are anonymized in the generated support file.</p>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
  	<td width="15%" valign="top" align="left">Heap Dump</td>
    <td width="85%" valign="top" align="left">Includes the heap dump data collection, which SAP support may use to analyze suspected memory issues.
    <p>CAUTION:</p>
    <p>(1) Keep in mind that you might generate very large amounts of data using this option and thus create a large support file.</p>
    <p>(2) Keep in mind that when creating a heap dump any data currently stored in memory is included in the support file. 
    This may also include passwords that are buffered locally. </p>    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
  	<td width="15%" valign="top" align="left">Screenshot</td>
    <td width="85%" valign="top" align="left">Creates a screenshot file of your entire desktop in.PNG format.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
  	<td width="15%" valign="top" align="left">Thread Dump</td>
    <td width="85%" valign="top" align="left">Collects all Java threads that can be used to analyze deadlock situations. </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
	<p>NOTE: The list of additional support data may be extended by additional extensions that are used to generate further support information. </p>
	</li>   
    <li>Choose <b>Finish</b>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The Support Information Collector utility creates an extended set of files and stores the ZIP file on 
the specified location on your local drive.
