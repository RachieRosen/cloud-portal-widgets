<h1>Adding Support File to OSS Message</h1>

<p>With the Support Information Collector, several support files have been generated for your IDE.  
All these files are bundled in one archive file, which is stored on the specified location on your local drive. 
You can then add this support file to your OSS support message as an attachment.   
</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> </p>
<p>If you think certain sensitive data should be excluded from the generated support files, 
you have the option to review the file contents before sending it to SAP support. 
Most data is stored in plain text format so that you can edit it to remove sensitive information.
