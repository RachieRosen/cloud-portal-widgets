<h1>Support Information Collector</h1>



<p>
Should errors occur in the context of Eclipse-based SAP development tools for which you, as an <b>SAP customer</b>, 
require more detailed support from SAP, it is of considerable importance that you provide all 
the required data for such a support case in order to speed up the troubleshooting process. 
For this purpose, SAP provides the Support Information Collector as a comfortable tool solution. 
With a few simple mouse clicks, you can <b>generate a support information file</b>. 
This file contains all the relevant data for your IDE or GUI version, 
as well as basic information on technical system environment data. 
You can then add this support file to your OSS problem message as an attachment.
</p>
<p>
In rare cases, however, it can happen that for detailed troubleshooting the SAP support team will 
request additional information from you. 
Then you can use the Support Information Collector utility to generate an <b>extended support file</b> version. 
This extended version can contain additional information about the RFC communication between the IDE client 
and the ABAP back-end system, or even heap dump, in the case of possible memory consumption issues. 
</p>

<h3>Confidential Information</h3>	
<p>The Support Information Collector may collect confidential information. This includes the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Information that is available in Java system properties, such as command line parameters</li>
		<li>Confidential data that has been written to the Eclipse log file</li>
		<li>Confidential data stored in Eclipse preferences
		<p><b>NOTE</b>: Passwords stored in the Eclipse secure storage are not included.</p>
		</li>
		<li>When you create a heap dump, any data currently stored in memory is included. 
		This may also enclose cached passwords. </li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p><b>RECOMMENDATION</b></p>
<p>If you think certain sensitive data should be excluded from the generated support files, 
make sure to review the created ZIP file before sending it to SAP support. 
Most data is stored in plain text format so that you can edit it to remove sensitive information.
